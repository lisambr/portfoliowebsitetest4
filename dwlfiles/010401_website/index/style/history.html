            <em>
                approx: 40 000 BC
            </em>
            <br>
            <br>
            One can say that the first doodle originated a long long time ago in a country very far away. So let’s travel to Indonesia, more precisely to the Lubang Jeriji Saléh cave, in East Kalimantan, Borneo. Right there, 40 000 years ago an aspiring doodler and passionate artist decided to draw a bull. Unfortunately, he did not explain the inspiration and motivation behind the doodle. But we can imagine that it was an absent minded drawing he probably made while on the phone with his grandma.
        </p>

            <em>
                15th century
            </em>
            <br>
            <br>
            After the infamous era of cave-doodles, some pretentious millenias passed where paint and brushes were trying to oppress our favourite art-form. An underground society of doodlers and pencil enthusiasts had to fight for their right in a world of Raphaels and Sandro Boticellis. But even the most famous Renaissance painters sometimes inclined into this famous weakness. Michelangelo has been famously discovered as a secret hand drawer/doodler.
        </p>

            <em>
                1977
            </em>
            <br>
            <br>
            A little further down in history the biggest nemesis of the doodling universe entered the public eye. The trinity of 1977's microcomputers (the Apple II, the TRS-80 Model I, and the Commodore PET) became very common in the 1980ies. These computers mark a dark age for the doodling community. The digital revolution replaced phone doodles and spontaneous scribbles in class, which created a new underground movement.

            <br>
            <br>
            Keith Haring was one of the big artists of the 21st century to digitalize the doodles and advocate for the cause of the hand-drawn doodle society. He was a voice for a generation of suppressed doodle enthusiasts and created a gateway for more and more people to join the movement.

            </em>
            <br>
            <br>With the rise of Pinterest, the hand drawings and doodles became a new popularity. And we are now in the golden age of doodling again. But we can see tablets,iPads and other options starting to threaten our favourite art-form of the throne.</p>
